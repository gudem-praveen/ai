#Exp 3: Tic-Tac-Toe game 
#AIM: To write a Program to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. 
#Input Graph : 
#Algorithm 
#Step 1: Initialize the Board 
#• Create a 3x3 grid (list of lists) initialized with empty spaces (' '). 
#Step 2: Define Functions 
#1. Display the board: 
#o Print the current state of the board. 
#2. Check for a win: 
#o Check all rows, columns, and diagonals to see if either player has won. 
#3. Check for a draw: 
#o If all cells are filled and there's no winner, declare a draw. 
#4. Take player input: 
#o Ask the user for a row and column number to place their mark (X or O). 
#o Ensure the move is valid (cell is not already occupied). 
#5. Switch turns: 
#o Alternate between X and O after each turn. 
#Step 3: Main Game Loop 
#• Repeat until there is a winner or a draw. 
#• Display the board after each move. 
#• Declare the winner or a draw when the game ends. 
#SOURCE CODE : 
# Tuple to store winning positions.
